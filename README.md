## Hi there, Iâ€™m Alessio Lenzi
- Learning Computer Science in Pisa, Italy!
- I'm 20 years old and I have three main hobbies, linux ricing/coding, training/running, listen to music.
- My personality could be described with few words: 
    1. driven by obsession, organized,
    2. ready to have fun, empathetic,
    3. reliable, detail-oriented.

That's something about me but there is SO MUCH MORE!!
